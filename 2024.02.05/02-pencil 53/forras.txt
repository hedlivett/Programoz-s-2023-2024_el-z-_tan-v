For ideas of all sizes.

“Apple’s new iPad Pro-only stylus can’t measure up to FiftyThree’s writing implement—it works with the iPhone, the iPad, and a number of iOS apps.”

Surface Pressure

Expressive from every angle. Pencil’s unique tip is shaped to create lines of all sizes without any settings. Use the point for fine details and the angled edge for broad strokes.


Erase

Be bold and make mistakes. Pencil’s unique built-in eraser lets you precisely carve away to get at what’s essential. No need to switch tools, just flip Pencil to erase.

Blend

Get hands-on with your ideas. Pencil takes care of the lines so you can use your finger to smooth rough edges and blend colors directly on the page. Create beautiful color transitions for charts, skies, and shadows.
